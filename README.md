FET Switch 
=======================
This is a small (0.7" x 0.9") PCB for using NMOS FETs
of different sizes (TO-220, SOT-223, DPAK). Included in
the design are components for creating a simple low-pass
filter circuit on the gate as well as an LED which turns
on when the FET is on. There is also a spot for a flyback
diode if the board is use to switch inductive loads. The 
PCB traces and input/output connections can support up to 
4A max continuous current. Connect the power source to IN 
and the load to OUT and use CTRL to turn FET on (CTRL = HIGH)
or off (CTRL = GND).
